Open up the Assets directory and click on Scenes. Then, open the file Menu.unity to start. Run the game, and you should see a fox, which is the player, and fruit that falls from the sky. There is also text on the side that shows how many lives you have and what your score is. To play, press the left and right arrow keys to move the player, and press the space bar to shoot mushrooms. You'll earn 1 point for catching the food that falls from the sky and 3 points for shooting it with a mushroom. If you let the food fall, you lose a life. Once your score surpasses 20 points, you win the game and get a free compliment! :)
